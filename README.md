# NAME

Plack::Middleware::StatsD - Plack middleware for logging request/response data with StatsD

# VERSION

version 0.0100

# SYNOPSIS

    use Plack::Builder;
    use Plack::Middleware::StatsD;

    my $app = sub { ... } # as usual

    # StatsD Options
    my %options = (
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 8125,
        sample_rate => 0.5,
        prefix => 'myapp',
        whitelist => sub {
            my ($req) = @_;
            ...
            # Return true to process, false to ignore
        },
        stat_name_mapper => sub {
            my ($req) = @_;
            ...
            # Return what to name the stat for this request
            return $req->path;
        },
    );

    builder {
        enable "Plack::Middleware::StatsD", %options;
        $app;
    };

With the above in place, [Plack::Middleware::StatsD](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Plack::Middleware::StatsD) will increment counters to
`PREFIX.STATUS_CODE` and `PREFIX./url/path.STATUS_CODE` to your statsd server.

It will also time your responses under `PREFIX./url/path.time` to your statsd
server as well.
